### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Daniel, a statistician and data scientist with a particular interest on applications in global public health and development policy.

I hold a master's degree in statistics from the University of Munich. Prior to my master's degree, I obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics with a minor in economics, also from the University of Munich.

My research interests are in Bayesian hierarchical modeling of spatio-temporal data and interpretable machine learning. I am also passionate about causal inference for public programme evaluation and machine learning for heterogeneous treatment effects. Other areas are survey data statistics and remotely sensed data.

If you'd like to chat about research, don't hesitate to get in touch!

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/daniel-seussler/) or at daniel dot seussler at outlook dot de. See also [danielseussler.github.io](https://danielseussler.github.io).
