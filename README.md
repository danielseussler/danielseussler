### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Daniel, a data scientist and researcher with expertise in statistical analysis, machine learning, and survey research. 
With a background in statistics and mathematics and experience across Africa and South Asia, I work at the intersection of development research and data analytics. 
My research interests are in probabilistic machine learning for epidemiological research and survey design and causal inference for public program evaluation.

I'm a German-Colombian dual citizen currently based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to chat about research!

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/daniel-seussler/) or write me at dseussler at outlook dot com.
